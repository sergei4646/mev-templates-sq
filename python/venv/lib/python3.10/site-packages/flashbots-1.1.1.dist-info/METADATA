This library works by injecting flashbots as a new module in the Web3.py instance, which allows submitting "bundles" of transactions directly to miners. This is done by also creating a middleware which captures calls to `eth_sendBundle` and `eth_callBundle`, and sends them to an RPC endpoint which you have specified, which corresponds to `mev-geth`.

To apply correct headers we use the `flashbot` method which injects the correct header on POST.

## Quickstart

```python
from eth_account.signers.local import LocalAccount
from web3 import Web3, HTTPProvider
from flashbots import flashbot
from eth_account.account import Account
import os

ETH_ACCOUNT_SIGNATURE: LocalAccount = Account.from_key(os.environ.get("ETH_SIGNATURE_KEY"))


w3 = Web3(HTTPProvider("http://localhost:8545"))
flashbot(w3, ETH_ACCOUNT_SIGNATURE)
```

Now the `w3.flashbots.sendBundle` method should be available to you. Look in [examples/simple.py](./examples/simple.py) for usage examples.

### Goerli

To use goerli, add the goerli relay RPC to the `flashbot` function arguments.

```python
flashbot(w3, ETH_ACCOUNT_SIGNATURE, "https://relay-goerli.flashbots.net")
```

## Development and testing

Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

Poetry will automatically fix your venv and all packages needed.

```sh
poetry install
```

Tips: PyCharm has a poetry plugin

## Simple Goerli Example

See [examples/simple.py](./examples/simple.py) for environment variable definitions.

```sh
poetry shell
ETH_SENDER_KEY=<sender_private_key> \nPROVIDER_URL=https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/<alchemy_key> \nETH_SIGNER_KEY=<signer_private_key> \npython examples/simple.py
```

## Linting

It's advisable to run black with default rules for linting

```sh
sudo pip install black # Black should be installed with a global entrypoint
black .
```
